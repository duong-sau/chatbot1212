Inferring site-specific rates,Advanced tutorial,1.0,10.0,"IQ-TREE allows to infer site-specific evolutionary rates if a site-rate heterogeneity model such as Gamma or FreeRate is the best model. Here, IQ-TREE will estimate model parameters and then apply an empirical Bayesian approach to assign site-rates as the mean over rate categories, weighted by the posterior probability of the site falling into each category. This approach is provided in IQ-TREE because such empirical Bayesian approach was shown to be most accurate (Mayrose et al., 2004). An example run:",112.0,2.0,0.5
