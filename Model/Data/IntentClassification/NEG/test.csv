Reducing impact of severe model violations with UFBoot,Beginner’s tutorial,2.0,18.0,Starting with IQ-TREE version 1.6 we provide a new option -bnni to reduce the risk of overestimating branch supports with UFBoot due to severe model violations. With this option UFBoot will further optimize each bootstrap tree using a hill-climbing nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) search based directly on the corresponding bootstrap alignment.,203.0

Moreover, IQ-TREE allows an even more complicated strategy: resampling partitions and then sites within resampled partitions (Gadagkar et al., 2005; Seo et al., 2005).
