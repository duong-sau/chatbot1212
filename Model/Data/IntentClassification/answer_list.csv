IQ-TREE will then estimate the model parameters separately for every partition. Moreover, IQ-TREE provides edge-linked or edge-unlinked branch lengths between partitions:",1.0
http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Advanced-Tutorial#partitioned-analysis-with-mixed-data,Partitioned analysis with mixed data,2.0,2.0,"IQ-TREE also allows combining sub-alignments from different alignment files, which is helpful if you want to combine mixed data (e.g. DNA and protein) in a single analysis. Here is an example for mixing DNA, protein and codon models:","Here, part1 and part2 contain sub-alignments from alignment file dna.phy, whereas part3 and part4 are loaded from alignment file prot.phy and part5 from codon.phy. The : is needed to separate the alignment file name and site specification. Note that, for convenience * in part5 specification means that part5 corresponds to the entire alignment codon.phy.",1.0

http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Advanced-Tutorial#constrained-tree-search,Constrained tree search,5.0,5.0,"IQ-TREE supports constrained tree search via -g option, so that the resulting tree must obey a constraint tree topology. The constraint tree can be multifurcating and need not to contain all species. To illustrate, letâ€™s return to the first running example, where we want to force Human grouping with Seal whereas Cow with Whale. If you use the following constraint tree (NEWICK format):",Save this to a file example.constr0 and run:,1.0

IQ-TREE first reconstructs an ML tree. Then, it will compute the log-likelihood of the trees in example.treels based on the estimated parameters done for the ML tree. example.phy.iqtree will have a section called USER TREES that lists the tree IDs and the corresponding log-likelihoods. The trees with optimized branch lengths can be found in example.phy.treels.trees If you only want to evaluate the trees without reconstructing the ML tree, you can run:",1.0

For example, 010010 corresponds to the HKY model and 012345 to the GTR model. In fact, IQ-TREE uses this specification internally to simplify the coding. The 6-letter code is specified via the -m option, e.g.:","Moreover, with the -m option one can input a file which contains the 6 rates (A-C, A-G, A-T, C-G, C-T, G-T) and 4 base frequencies (A, C, G, T).

Here, IQ-TREE will estimate model parameters and then apply an empirical Bayesian approach to assign site-rates as the mean over rate categories, weighted by the posterior probability of the site falling into each category. This approach is provided in IQ-TREE because such empirical Bayesian approach was shown to be most accurate (Mayrose et al., 2004).
