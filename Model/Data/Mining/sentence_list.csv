ModelFinder computes the log-likelihoods of an initial parsimony tree for many different models and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Then ModelFinder chooses the model that minimizes the BIC score (you can also change to AIC or AICc by adding the option -AIC or -AICc, respectively).",16.0,Beginner’s tutorial,3.0,6.0

To address this issue we introduce the General Heterogeneous evolution On a Single Topology (GHOST) model. More specifically, GHOST is an edge-unlinked mixture model consisting of several site classes, each having a separate set of model parameters and edge lengths on the same tree topology. Thus, GHOST naturally accounts for heterotachous evolution. In contrast to an edge-unlinked partition model, the GHOST model does not require the a priori data partitioning, a possible source of model misspecification.",56.0,Complex models,6.0,2.0

622.0,What is the purpose of composition test?,"If you have partitioned (multi-gene) data, it might be more reasonable to test this separately for each partition in a partition analysis.

Or on the other hand if a sequence fails for many partitions and show very unexpected phylogenetic topologies, try without it.If you have (phylogenomic) protein data, you can also try several protein mixture models, which account for different amino-acid compositions along the sequences, for example, the C10 to C60 profile mixture models.Finally, it is recommended to always check the alignment (something one should always do anyway), especially if they have been collected and produced automatically.",71.0,Frequently asked questions,9.0,9.0

628.0,How do I save time for standard bootstrap?,"The standard bootstrap is rather slow and may take weeks/months for large data sets. One way to speed up is to use the multicore version. However, this only works well for long alignments (see What is the good number of CPU cores to use?). Another way is to use many machines or a computing cluster and split the computation among the machines. To illustrate, you want to perform 100 bootstrap replicates and have 5 PCs, each has 4 CPU cores. Then you can:",73.0,Frequently asked questions,9.0,2.0
629.0,How do I save time for standard bootstrap?,"Perform 5 independent bootstrap runs (each with 20 replicates) on the 5 machines with 5 prefix outputs (such that output files are not overwritten). For example: # For old IQ-TREE versions <= 1.5.X, change iqtree to iqtree-omp

 iqtree -nt 4 -s input_alignment -bo 20 ... -pre boot4

Note that if you have access to a computing cluster, you may want to submit these jobs onto the cluster queue in parallel and with even more fined grained parallelization (e.g. one replicate per job).Once all 5 runs finished, combine the 5 .boottrees file into one file (e.g. by cat command under Linux): cat boot*.boottrees > alltrees
Construct a consensus tree from the combined bootstrap trees: iqtree -con -t alltrees
The consensus tree is then written to .contree file.Estimate branch lengths of the consensus tree using the original alignment: iqtree -s input_alignment -te alltrees.contree -pre alltrees.contree
You can also perform the analysis on the original alignment: # For old IQ-TREE versions <= 1.5.X, change iqtree to iqtree-omp
 iqtree -nt 4 -s input_alignment ...

640.0,How does IQ-TREE treat identical sequences?,"Among a group of identical sequences, IQ-TREE will keep the first two and ignore the rest. If the sequence is the 2nd one, it will be “kept for subsequent analysis”. If it is the 3rd or more, it will be “ignored but added at the end”. The rationale for this is to still be able to calculate the bootstrap support for this group of identical sequences: it is not always 100%. Because by bootstrap resampling, on average only two third of the sites will be present in a bootstrap alignment (due to sampling with replacement), and suddenly another sequence not in this group may actually become identical to this group of sequences. In that case, the bootstrap value will be < 100%.",75.0,Frequently asked questions,9.0,2.0

643.0,What are the differences between alignment columns/sites and patterns?,"Columns are the columns/sites in the alignment and the number of columns is the length of the alignment. In the alignment there might be the same columns. Different columns are called patterns. While (parsimony) informative sites are patterns that have at least two different characters (nucleotides or amino acids) and each character should occur in at least two species. Essentially, informative sites have information for the grouping of species. These patterns are mainly important in the context of parsimony, where no evolutionary model is used. In maximum likelihood inference all patterns containing different characters are important for the estimation of tree topology and branch lengths, while constant/invariant sites (containing only the same character: only A’s or only G’s etc) are important for the correct estimation of the branch lengths. Therefore, should not be excluded from the alignment.",76.0,Frequently asked questions,9.0,2.0

DESCRIPTION
	This program estimates the rate and the dates of the input phylogenies given some temporal constraints.
	It minimizes the square errors of the branch lengths under normal distribution model.

SYNOPSIS
	./lsd [-i inputFile] [-d inputDateFile] [-o outputFile] [-s sequenceLength] [-g outgroupFile] [-f nbSamplings] 
OPTIONS
	-a rootDate
	   To specify the root date if there's any. If the root date is not a number, but a string (ex: 2020-01-10, or b(2019,2020)) then it should
	   be put between the quotes.
	-b varianceParameter
	   The parameter (between 0 and 1) to compute the variances in option -v. It is the pseudo positive constant to add to the branch lengths
	   when calculating variances, to adjust the dependency of variances to branch lengths. By default b is the maximum between median branch length
	   and 10/seqlength; but it should be adjusted  based on how/whether the input tree is relaxed or strict. The smaller it is the more variances
	   would be linear to branch lengths, which is relevant for strict clock. The bigger it is the less effect of branch lengths on variances, 
	   which might be better for relaxed clock.
	-d inputDateFile
	   This options is used to read the name of the input date file which contains temporal constraints of internal nodes
	   or tips. An internal node can be defined either by its label (given in the input tree) or by a subset of tips that have it as 
	   the most recent common ancestor (mrca). A date could be a real or a string or format year-month-day.
	   The first line of this file is the number of temporal constraints. A temporal constraint can be fixed date, or a 
	   lower bound l(value), or an upper bound u(value), or an interval b(v1,v2)
	   For example, if the input tree has 4 taxa a,b,c,d, and an internal node named n, then following is a possible date file:
	    6
	    a l(2003.12)
	    b u(2007.07)
	    c 2005
	    d b(2001.2,2007.11)
	    mrca(a,b,c,d) b(2000,2001)
	    n l(2004.3)
	   If this option is omitted, and option -a, -z are also omitted, the program will estimate relative dates by giving T[root]=0 and T[tips]=1.
	-D outDateFormat
	    Specify output date format: 1 for real, 2 for year-month-day. By default the program will guess the format of input dates and uses it for
	    output dates.
	-e ZscoreOutlier
	   This option is used to estimate and exclude outlier nodes before dating process.
	   LSD2 normalize the branch residus and decide a node is outlier if its related residus is great than the ZscoreOutlier.
	   A normal value of ZscoreOutliercould be 3, but you can adjust it bigger/smaller depending if you want to have
	   less/more outliers. Note that for now, some functionalities could not be combined with outliers estimation, for example 
	   estimating multiple rates, imprecise date constraints.
	-f samplingNumberCI
	   This option calculates the confidence intervals of the estimated rate and dates. The branch lengths of the esimated
	   tree are sampled samplingNumberCI times to generate a set of simulated trees. To generate simulated lengths
	   for each branch, we use a Poisson distribution whose mean equals to the estimated one multiplied by the sequence length, which is 
	   1000 by default if nothing was specified via option -s. Long sequence length tends to give small confidence intervals. To avoid 
	   over-estimate the confidence intervals in the case of very long sequence length but not necessarily strict molecular clock, you 
	   could use a smaller sequence length than the actual ones. Confidence intervals are written in the nexus tree with label CI_height,
	   and can be visualzed with Figtree under Node bar feature.
	-g outgroupFile
	   If your data contain outgroups, then specify the name of the outgroup file here. The program will use the outgroups to root the trees.
	   If you use this combined with options -G, then the outgroups will be removed. The format of this file should be:
	        n
	        OUTGROUP1
	        OUTGROUP2
	        ...
	        OUTGROUPn
	-F 
	   By default without this option, we impose the constraints that the date of every node is equal or smaller then the
	   dates of its descendants, so the running time is quasi-linear. Using this option we ignore this temporal constraints, and
	   the the running time becomes linear, much faster.
	-h help
	   Print this message.
	-i inputTreesFile
	   The name of the input trees file. It contains tree(s) in newick format, each tree on one line. Note that the taxa sets of all
	   trees must be the same.
	-j
	   Verbose mode for output messages.
	-G
	   Use this option to remove the outgroups (given in option -g) in the estimated tree. If this option is not used, the outgroups 
	   will be kept and the root position in estimated on the branch defined by the outgroups.
	-l nullBlen
	   A branch in the input tree is considered informative if its length is greater this value. By default it is 0.5/seq_length. Only 
	   informative branches are forced to be bigger than a minimum branch length (see option -u for more information about this).
	-m samplingNumberOutlier
	   The number of dated nodes to be sampled when detecting outlier nodes. This should be smaller than the number of dated nodes,
	   and is 10 by default.
	-n datasetNumber
	   The number of trees that you want to read and analyse.
	-o outputFile
	   The base name of the output files to write the results and the time-scale trees.
	-p partitionFile
	   The file that defines the partition of branches into multiple subsets in the case that you know each subset has a different rate.
	   In the partition file, each line contains the name of the group, the prior proportion of the group rate compared to the main rate
	   (selecting an appropriate value for this helps to converge faster), and a list of subtrees whose branches are supposed to have the 
	   same substitution rate. All branches that are not assigned to any subtree form a group having another rate.
	   A subtree is defined between {}: its first node corresponds to the root of the subtree, and the following nodes (if there any) 
	   correspond to the tips of the subtree. If the first node is a tip label then it takes the mrca of all tips as the root of the subtree.
	   If the tips of the subtree are not defined (so there's only the defined root), then by 
	   default this subtree is extended down to the tips of the full tree. For example the input tree is 
	   ((A:0.12,D:0.12)n1:0.3,((B:0.3,C:0.5)n2:0.4,(E:0.5,(F:0.2,G:0.3)n3:0.33)n4:0.22)n5:0.2)root;
	   and you have the following partition file:
	         group1 1 {n1} {n5 n4}
	         group2 1 {n3}
	   then there are 3 rates: the first one includes the branches (n1,A), (n1,D), (n5,n4), (n5,n2), (n2,B), (n2,C); the second one 
	   includes the branches (n3,F), (n3,G), and the last one includes all the remaining branches. If the internal nodes don't have labels,
	   then they can be defined by mrca of at least two tips, for example n1 is mrca(A,D)
	-q standardDeviationRelaxedClock
	   This value is involved in calculating confidence intervals to simulate a lognormal relaxed clock. We multiply the simulated branch lengths
	   with a lognormal distribution with mean 1, and standard deviation q. By default q is 0.2. The bigger q is, the more your tree is relaxed
	   and give you bigger confidence intervals.
	-r rootingMethod
	   This option is used to specify the rooting method to estimate the position of the root for unrooted trees, or
	   re-estimate the root for rooted trees. The principle is to search for the position of the root that minimizes
	   the objective function.
	   Use -r l if your tree is rooted, and you want to re-estimate the root locally around the given root.
	   Use -r a if you want to estimate the root on all branches (ignoring the given root if the tree is rooted).
	       In this case, if the constrained mode is chosen (option -c), method ""a"" first estimates the root without using the constraints.
	       After that, it uses the constrained mode to improve locally the position of the root around this pre-estimated root.
	   Use -r as if you want to estimate to root using constrained mode on all branches.
	   Use -r k if you want to re-estimate the root position on the same branche of the given root.
	       If combined with option -g, the root will be estimated on the branche defined by the outgroups.
	-R round_time
	   This value is used to round the minimum branch length of the time scaled tree. The purpose of this is to make the minimum branch length
	   a meaningful time unit, such as day, week, year ... By default this value is 365, so if the input dates are year, the minimum branch
	   length is rounded to day. The rounding formula is round(R*minblen)/R.
	-s sequenceLength
	   This option is used to specify the sequence length when estimating confidence intervals (option -f). It is used to generate 
	   integer branch lengths (number of substitutions) by multiplying this with the estimated branch lengths. By default it is 1000.
	-S minSupport
	   Together with collapsing internal short branches (see option -l), users can also collapse internal branches having weak support values (if
	   provided in the input tree) by using this option. The program will collapse all internal branches having support <= the specifed value.
	-t rateLowerBound
	   This option corresponds to the lower bound for the estimating rate. It is 1e-10 by default.
	-u minBlen
	   By default without this option, lsd2 forces every branch of the time scaled tree to be greater than 1/(seq_length*rate) where rate is
	   an pre-estimated median rate. This value is rounded to the number of days or weeks or years, depending on the rounding parameter -R.
	   By using option -u, the program will not estimate the minimum branch length but use the specified value instead.
	-U minExBlen
	   Similar to option -u but applies for external branches if specified. If it's not specified then the minimum branch length of external
	   branches is set the same as the one of internal branch.
	-v variance
	   Use this option to specify the way you want to apply variances for the branch lengths. Variances are used to recompense big errors on
	   long estimated branch lengths. The variance of the branch Bi is Vi = (Bi+b) where b is specified by option -b.
	   If variance=0, then we don't use variance. If variance=1, then LSD uses the input branch lengths to calculate variances.
	   If variance=2, then LSD runs twice where the second time it calculates the variances based on the estimated branch
	   lengths of the first run. By default variance=1.
	-V 
	   Get the actual version.
	-w givenRte
	   This option is used to specify the name of the file containing the substitution rates.
	   In this case, the program will use the given rates to estimate the dates of the nodes.
	   This file should have the following format
	        RATE1
	        RATE2
	        ...
	  where RATEi is the rate of the tree i in the inputTreesFile.
	-z tipsDate
	   To specify the tips date if they are all equal. If the tips date is not a number, but a string (ex: 2020-01-10, or b(2019,2020))
	   then it should be put between the quotes.
