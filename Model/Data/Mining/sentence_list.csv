Frequently asked questions,9.0,How do I interpret ultrafast bootstrap (UFBoot) support values?,67.0,"How do I interpret ultrafast bootstrap (UFBoot) support values?The ultrafast bootstrap (UFBoot) feature (-bb option) was published in (Minh et al., 2013).One of the main conclusions is, that UFBoot support values are more unbiased 95% support correspond roughly to a probability of 95% that a clade is true.So this has a different meaning than the normal bootstrap supports (where you start to believe in the clade if it has >80% BS support).",204.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,How do I interpret ultrafast bootstrap (UFBoot) support values?,67.0,"For UFBoot, you should only start to believe in a clade if its support is >= 95%.Thus, the interpretations are different and you should not compare BS% with UFBoot% directly.Moreover, it is recommended to also perform the SH-aLRT test (Guindon et al., 2010) by adding -alrt 1000 into the   command line.Each branch will then be assigned with SH-aLRT and UFBoot supports.",205.0

Frequently asked questions,9.0,How does IQ-TREE treat gap/missing/ambiguous characters?,68.0,"How does   treat gap/missing/ambiguous characters?Gaps (-) and missing characters (?or N for DNA alignments) are treated in the same way as unknown characters, which represent no information.The same treatment holds for many other ML software (e.g., RAxML, PhyML).",207.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,How does IQ-TREE treat gap/missing/ambiguous characters?,68.0,"More explicitly, for a site (column) of an alignment containing AC-AG-A (i.e.A for sequence 1, C for sequence 2, - for sequence 3, and so on), the site-likelihood of a tree T is equal to the site-likelihood of the subtree of T restricted to those sequences containing non-gap characters (ACAGA).Ambiguous characters that represent more than one character are also supported each represented character will have equal likelihood.For DNA the following ambigous nucleotides are supported according to IUPAC nomenclatureNucleotideMeaningRA or G (purine)YC or T (pyrimidine)WA or T (weak)SG or C (strong)MA or C (amino)KG or T (keto)BC, G or T (next letter after A)HA, C or T (next letter after G)DA, G or T (next letter after C)VA, G or C (next letter after T)?, -, ., ~, O, N, XA, G, C or T (unknown; all 4 nucleotides are equally likely)For protein the following ambiguous amino-acids are supportedAmino-acidMeaningBN or DZQ or EJI or LUunknown AA (although it is the 21st AA)?, -, ., ~, * or Xunknown AA (all 20 AAs are equally likely)",208.0

Frequently asked questions,9.0,Can I mix DNA and protein data in a partitioned analysis?,69.0,"To do so, each data type should be stored in a separate alignment file (see also Partitioned analysis with mixed data).As an example, assuming dna.phy is a DNA alignment and and prot.phy is a protein alignment.Then a partition file mixing two types of data can be specified as followsnexusbegin sets;    charset part1 = dna.phy 1-100 201-300;    charset part2 = dna.phy 101-200;    charset part3 = prot.phy 1-150;    charset part4 = prot.phy 151-400;    charpartition mine = HKYpart1, GTR Gpart2, WAG I Gpart3, LG Gpart4;end;NOTE The site count for each alignment should start from 1, and not continue from the last position of a previous alignment (e.g., see part3 and part4 declared above).",210.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What is the interpretation of branch lengths when mixing codon and DNA data?,70.0,"What is the interpretation of branch lengths when mixing codon and DNA data?When mixing codon and DNA data in a partitioned analysis, the branch lengths are interpreted as the number of nucleotide substitutions per nucleotide siteThis is different from having only codon data, where branch lengths are the number of nucleotide substitutions per codon site (thus typically 3 times longer than under DNA models).Note that if you mix codon, DNA and protein data, the branch lengths are then the number of character substitutions per site, where character is either nucleotide or amino-acid.",211.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What is the purpose of composition test?,71.0,"What is the purpose of composition test?At the beginning of each run,   performs a composition chi-square test for every sequence in the alignment.The purpose is to test for homogeneity of character composition (e.g., nucleotide for DNA, amino-acid for protein sequences).A sequence is denoted failed if its character composition significantly deviates from the average composition of the alignment.More specifically, for each sequence, computechi2 = \sum_{i=1}^k (O_i - E_i)^2 / E_iwhere k is the size of the alphabet (e.g.",212.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What is the purpose of composition test?,71.0,"4 for DNA, 20 for amino acids) and the values 1 to k correspond uniquely to one of the characters.O_i is the character frequency in the sequence tested.E_i is the overall character frequency from the entire alignment.Whether the character composition deviates significantly from the overall composition is done by testing the chi2 value using the chi2-distribution with k-1 degrees of freedom (df=3 for DNA or df=19 for amino acids).",213.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What is the purpose of composition test?,71.0,"By and large it is a normal Chi^2 test.This test should be regarded as an explorative tool which might help to nail down problems in a dataset.One would typically not remove failing sequences by default.But if the tree shows unexpected topology the test might point in direction of the origin of the problem.Furthermore, please keep in mind, this test is performed at the very beginning, where   does not know anything about the models yet.",214.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What is the purpose of composition test?,71.0,"That meansIf you have partitioned (multi-gene) data, it might be more reasonable to test this separately for each partition in a partition analysis.Here, one might want to be able to decide whether some partitions should better be discarded if it is hard to find a composition representing the sequences in the partition.Or on the other hand if a sequence fails for many partitions and show very unexpected phylogenetic topologies, try without it.If you have (phylogenomic) protein data, you can also try several protein mixture models, which account for different amino-acid compositions along the sequences, for example, the C10 to C60 profile mixture models.Finally, it is recommended to always check the alignment (something one should always do anyway), especially if they have been collected and produced automatically.",215.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What is the good number of CPU cores to use?,72.0,"What is the good number of CPU cores to use?Starting with version 1.5.1, you can use option -nt AUTO to automatically determine the best number of threads for your current data and computer.If you want to know more details   can utilize multicore machines to speed up the analysis via -nt option.However, it does not mean that using more cores will always result in less running time if your alignment is short, using too many cores may even slow down the analysis.This is because   parallelizes the likelihood computation along the alignment.",216.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What is the good number of CPU cores to use?,72.0,"Thus, the parallel efficiency is only increased with longer alignments.If you want to restrict the number of CPU cores allocated by -nt AUTO use -ntmax to specify the maximal number of CPU cores allowed (DEFAULT CPU cores on the current machine).",217.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,How do I save time for standard bootstrap?,73.0,"How do I save time for standard bootstrap?The standard bootstrap is rather slow and may take weeks/months for large data sets.One way to speed up is to use the multicore version.However, this only works well for long alignments (see What is the good number of CPU cores to use?).",218.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,How do I save time for standard bootstrap?,73.0,"Another way is to use many machines or a computing cluster and split the computation among the machines.To illustrate, you want to perform 100 bootstrap replicates and have 5 PCs, each has 4 CPU cores.Then you canPerform 5 independent bootstrap runs (each with 20 replicates) on the 5 machines with 5 prefix outputs (such that output files are not overwritten).",219.0

Frequently asked questions,9.0,Why does IQ-TREE complain about the use of +ASC model?,74.0,"For example, at a particular site some sequences show a G (Guanine), some sequences have - (gap) and the other have N.Ambiguously constant sites For example, some sequences show a C (Cytosine), some show a Y (meaning C or T) and some show a - (gap).All these sites must be removed from the alignment before a  ASC model can be applied.TIP Starting with   version 1.5.0, an output alignment file with suffix .varsites is written in such cases, which contain only variable sites from the input alignment.The .varsites alignment can then be used with the  ASC model.",222.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,How does IQ-TREE treat identical sequences?,75.0,"How does   treat identical sequences?Among a group of identical sequences,   will keep the first two and ignore the rest.If the sequence is the 2nd one, it will be “kept for subsequent analysis”.If it is the 3rd or more, it will be “ignored but added at the end”.",223.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,How does IQ-TREE treat identical sequences?,75.0,"The rationale for this is to still be able to calculate the bootstrap support for this group of identical sequences it is not always 100%.Because by bootstrap resampling, on average only two third of the sites will be present in a bootstrap alignment (due to sampling with replacement), and suddenly another sequence not in this group may actually become identical to this group of sequences.In that case, the bootstrap value will be < 100%.Therefore, the .uniqueseq.phy printed by   may still contain the identical sequences, but no more than two of each identical group.",224.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What are the differences between alignment columns/sites and patterns?,76.0,What are the differences between alignment columns/sites and patterns?Columns are the columns/sites in the alignment and the number of columns is the length of the alignment.In the alignment there might be the same columns.Different columns are called patterns.,225.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What are the differences between alignment columns/sites and patterns?,76.0,"While (parsimony) informative sites are patterns that have at least two different characters (nucleotides or amino acids) and each character should occur in at least two species.Essentially, informative sites have information for the grouping of species.These patterns are mainly important in the context of parsimony, where no evolutionary model is used.",226.0
Frequently asked questions,9.0,What are the differences between alignment columns/sites and patterns?,76.0,"In maximum likelihood inference all patterns containing different characters are important for the estimation of tree topology and branch lengths, while constant/invariant sites (containing only the same character only A’s or only G’s etc) are important for the correct estimation of the branch lengths.Therefore, should not be excluded from the alignment.Example            123456789species_1   AACGTACGTspecies_2   AACGATCGTspecies_3   AACCGTCCTspecies_4   AACCTACCTsites/columns 1 and 2 are identical and contain only A’s - invariant site pattern, uninformativesites/columns 3 and 7 are identical and contain only C’s - invariant site pattern, uninformativesites/columns 4 and 8 are identical and contain 2 G’c and 2 C’s - informative site patternsites/columns 5, 6 and 9 occur only once, each site is a different pattern.5th is uninformative, 6th is informative, 9th is invariant and uninformativeSumming up, the alignment has 9 columns,6 patternsA C G T A TA C G A T TA C C G T TA C C T A T(2 informative)G A G T C T C A",227.0
