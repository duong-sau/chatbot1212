1	72	Recently, I tried to use the iqtree for reconstructing ancestral sequences. But, I have a problem I don't know to solve. How assign the name to the node of a rooted tree? Because I want to obtain the ancestral sequences at the node of interest. I appreciate any help. Thank you very much.
2	16	Hi all,I am using IQTREE to estimate branch lengths on a fixed tree topology for binary, morphological data. Whenever I apply the MK model to the data, I get the following error message: ERROR: File not found MK And because of this, I have to use the GTR2 model. I have attached the commands I use to run this. Is there any way to use the Mk model with binary morphological data in IQTREE (I am using version 2.0.6 on macOS, but have found the exact same issue with 2.1.2). I think this should be possible, not too sure what is going wrong! -s binary_morph_data.nex -g fixed_tree.phy -bb 1000 -st MORPH -T AUTO -m MK+ASC+G4+FQ 0Thanks all, Yasmin
3	48	I built a phylogeny using iqtree after running Gubbins to mask SNPs resulting from predicted recombinations. Some lineages in my tree appear to be highly recombinogenic and up to half of the SNP calls are masked by recombination prediction (represented by Ns). I'm wondering if this will make all the branch lengths in these lineages artificially too short, because the number of unmasked SNPs is roughly half in some lineages compared to others; or if iqtree adjusts for this by considering the number of missing sites in each sequence. ie. can I trust my phylogeny if some samples have a very high % of missing sites?
4	53	Hi all, I'm currently trying to infer a concatenated tree using the command: iqtree -p <directory of alignments> --prefix <output prefix> -B 1000 -T 120 I have ~12,000 loci with at most 98 species, and these loci are roughly gene length. From other threads posted here and on github, I get the impression that ModelFinder should be parallelized across input partitions/sequences. So if I understand that correctly, this command should be running ModelFinder on 120 sequences at once. However, the time it is taking and is expected to take seems steep: it has completed only 128 loci in 6 hours and is estimating 628 hours (or 26 days) left to complete the rest. As a comparison, I built individual locus trees from this set of loci using a total of 120 threads and 1 thread per locus. This completed full tree inference (including ModelFinder for each locus) in 4 days. This gives me the impression that either (1) ModelFinder is not running on the loci in parallel or (2) I'm misunderstanding how ModelFinder is supposed to work in these analyses. I think a possible workaround would be to manually concatenate all the loci and use a partition file with charpartition mine set for each locus using the ModelFinder results from the individual locus tree runs. But I wanted to check here first to make sure I'm not missing something. Any points to clarify this for me are appreciated!

5	12	I have found an interesting bug with IQTree 2.1.2 that is not present in 2.0.6 or 1.6.12. Please reach out to me if the input I used with full logs is needed. Expected Behavior: IQTree runs on the input.fasta file. BUG: input.fasta runs successfully on IQTree 1.6.12 but not on 2.1.2. Detailed Description: input.fasta has 6 sequences. When IQTree 1.6.12 is run using input.fasta as input, the program runs successfully. However when IQTree 2.1.2 is run using the same input, the bionj tree computed only contains four taxa and IQTree fails to run. Seed was fixed to be 10101, and I've tested on three different platforms with the same results every time. The sequences are not identical and therefore I don't think -keep-ident option would help in this case. I can confirm that in IQTree version 2.0.6, the same input.fasta runs successfully with no issues.

6	16	The +ASC model is automatically added for any partition that has no invariant sites. That might happen for non-SNP data. Here, your 3rd codon positions are so variable that this is the case. If you think this does not make sense, then you can manually remove +ASC in the printed partition file and rerun the analysis with that modified partition file.
7	72	I am using IQ-TREE to for phylogenetic dating. My calibration points have minimums and maximums, such as 372.2 -121.8 million years. However, I do not see option in the manual to provide a date range when calibrating ancestral nodes. Would I calibrate a node given that I have a range rather than a single point estimate?
8	14	I have created a file indels.phy composed of coded indels, including multi-state indels, from cpDNA of alders (pop gen study). The indel states are coded as A (consistent with reference), B, C, D, and E (various indel forms). Most columns have just A and B forms. Does anyone have a suggestion how best to handle this data? I ran using -m MFP and the selected model was mtVer (mitochondrial amino acid substitution model) which is not likely the best fit.. I could convert the data to binary (presence/absence of every indel form) if there is not a good way to handle the multi-state data. Once I settle this, I plan to run a partitioned analysis combining coded indels and DNA alignments.
9	20	I'm trying to use IQTREE2 to perform a SH-test. I did a test run, for example: iqtree -s test.phy -m GTR -te best_ML.tre -z test_trees.tre -nt $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --alrt 10000 --prefix test_-alrt and I have a couple questions: 1. the tree plotted in the ".iqtree" file with Numbers in parentheses are SH-aLRT support (%), is it the Best ML tree? re-estimated from the alignment user provided? If the LikeliHood of the estimated tree is better than the provided best_ML tree, then the better ML tree will output into ".treefile" file? Otherwise, still will use the best_ML tree user provided (via -te)? Is it possible to provide SH-aLRT support on a user provided best_ML tree? 2. If user has already provided trees bia "-z", why output all the trees in ".trees" file? Seems redundant to me, because some infor like "tree index" and "likelihood", aren't these already provided on the ".iqtree" file or log file?
10	37	Dear colleagues, Trying to streamline some analyses for students, and love the inferring species tree option in iq-tree with -p for specifying alignment directories. Does iq-tree have a way to output the supermatrx it creates for running the species tree? I don't see it in the output files or as an option. Apologies if I've missed this.
11	4	I am using IQtree2.1.2-linux. I did a run using 18 strains of the same species with 1 outgroup strain. So 19 genomes total. I did the run using the command below. bin/iqtree2 -p "Cpse_1390_C90" --prefix Cpse_withOutgroup -alrt 1000 -B 1000 -T 16 -o (outgroup) The issue I am having is there is no bootstrap value at the node where the outgroup clades away and then also at the first node where my species of interest clades apart there is no bootstrap value. I am using the .contree file to visualize the tree. I also tried running the same code without defining the outgroup to see if that would fix the problem but it did not.
