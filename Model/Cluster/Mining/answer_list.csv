http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Frequently-Asked-Questions#virtual-population-size,84.0,Polymorphism-aware models,9.0,"PoMo describes the evolution of populations along a phylogeny by means of a virtual population of constant size N, which defaults to nine (for details, see Schrempf et al., 2016). This is a good and stable default value. If only very few chromosomes have been sequenced per population (e.g., two to four), N should be lowered to the average number of chromosomes per population. If enough data is available and calculations are not too time consuming, we advise to increase N up to a maximum of 19. You can choose odd values from three to 19 as well as 2 and 10.

When analyzing population data, the amount of polymorphism is inferred during maximization of the likelihood. However, in some situations it may be useful to set the level of polymorphism to the observed value in the data (empirical value):",Level of polymorphism,85.0

As of version 1.6, only discrete Gamma rate heterogeneity is supported. Please be aware, that for biological and mathematical reasons (we cannot simply scale the full transition matrix but have to separate the mutational component from genetic drift), the run time scales linearly with the number of rate categories. In the future, we plan to work on decreasing run time as well as implement more rate heterogeneity types. To use a discrete Gamma model with 4 rate categories, use:",Rate heterogeneity,88.0

The number of drift events compared to the number of mutations becomes higher if the virtual population size is increased. To get the branch length measured in number of substitutions per site which enables a comparison to the branch length estimated by standard DNA substitution models, it has to be divided by N^2. PoMo also outputs the total tree length measured in number of substitutions per site in example.cf.iqtree. An example of the relevant section:",Interpretation of branch lengths,90.0
